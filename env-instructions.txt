# Instructions for Setting Up Your .env File

Your current .env file is missing several important configurations needed for the email notification functionality. Please add the following to your .env file:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
URL=http://localhost:5000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=5h
RESET_PASSWORD_KEY=your_reset_password_key

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_database_password
DB_NAME=cumsdbms

# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
```

## Important Notes:

1. Replace `your_session_secret`, `your_jwt_secret`, and `your_reset_password_key` with secure random strings.
2. Replace `your_database_password` with your actual MySQL password (leave empty if no password).
3. Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address.
4. Replace `your-gmail-app-password` with your Gmail App Password (not your regular Gmail password).

## How to Create a Gmail App Password:

1. Go to your Google Account at https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security"
3. Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords"
   (You might need to enable 2-Step Verification first)
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
5. Enter "Sahyadri College Management" as the name
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character password
8. Add this password to your .env file as EMAIL_PASSWORD

These email settings are required for the attendance notification feature to work properly.
